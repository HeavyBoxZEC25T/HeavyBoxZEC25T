### Idiots call themselves
- 👋 Hi, I’m @JunmoreHeavyBox
- 👀 I like trains, but mainly push pull trains and multi energy mode trains, then various vehicles and mechanical principles, video games, etc. (As long as I don't mention liminal space and weirdcore, dreamcore, etc.)
- 🌱 I'm a semi-dropout right now and I need to learn everything... I'm wasting my time at the moment.
- 💞️ I wasn’t going to work on any projects until I learned to code. I'm not in a hurry to seek cooperation.

### 📫 Contact
- Come to Sina Weibo to search for "[硬盒橘猫59612](http://weibo.com/u/7608228416/)" to follow me daily life. If you can read Chinese...
  - Here I'll post some modeling routines and openBVE routines and trivial gossip...
- 3190418463@qq.com is my email address. (Don't want to change to a normal email...)
- I don't want to mention the other platforms' accounts...

If the above contact information is invalid, you can consider me dead.
